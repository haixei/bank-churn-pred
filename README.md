# Bank Customer Churn Prediction & Action

Banking is bigger than ever before, with new institutions emerging, data science paves the way to innovation. In this project I'm going to look at bank data and analyse its customer churn trends as well as create a model that predicts a possibility of the customer leaving in the near time. I will be using data from Kaggle.
